# PHASE 80.2 — REAL USAGE VALIDATION (READ-ONLY CLI)

Status: ACTIVE  
Phase: 80.2  
Scope: Real Usage Validation  
Applies to: Sapianta Chat CLI  
Authority: Core-Locked (Phase 72)

---

## 0. PURPOSE

This document captures **real-world validation**
of the Sapianta Chat CLI in practical use.

The goal is to:
- confirm what is genuinely useful
- identify what is unnecessary or unused
- detect friction without immediately fixing it

This phase is **observational only**.
No changes are proposed or implemented here.

---

## 1. VALIDATION METHOD

Validation is based on:
- actual CLI usage
- real questions asked by humans
- repeated patterns (or lack thereof)
- moments of confusion or clarity

No synthetic or hypothetical scenarios are used.

---

## 2. OBSERVED USE CASES (EXAMPLES)

### 2.1 SYSTEM ORIENTATION

Observed usage:
- `status`
- `read registry`

Assessment:
- ✔ highly useful
- ✔ fast orientation
- ✔ reduces cognitive load

Notes:
- output clarity is more important than completeness

---

### 2.2 GOVERNANCE UNDERSTANDING

Observed usage:
- `describe phase 72`
- `read phase 74.2`
- `read mpd sapianta_chat_cli`

Assessment:
- ✔ critical for trust
- ✔ prevents misuse
- ✔ supports audit conversations

Notes:
- sequential reading matters more than single commands

---

### 2.3 OWNER DAILY REFERENCE

Observed usage:
- “Where are we?”
- “What is allowed now?”
- “Is execution possible anywhere?”

Assessment:
- ✔ acts as authoritative memory
- ✔ replaces manual document search

Notes:
- CLI is used as a *thinking aid*, not a tool

---

### 2.4 AUDIT / REVIEW SESSIONS

Observed usage:
- `status`
- `read phase 79.1`
- `read phase 79.2`

Assessment:
- ✔ strong confidence signal
- ✔ zero-risk inspection
- ✔ no need for system access

Notes:
- CLI behaves as a governance window

---

## 3. WHAT IS USED VS UNUSED

### Frequently Used
- status
- read registry
- read phase <id>
- describe phase <id>

### Rarely Used
- long descriptive chains
- deeply nested document reading

### Not Used
- any hypothetical execution-related commands
- any form of automation

---

## 4. FRICTION POINTS (OBSERVED)

- users sometimes expect “help” to be more explanatory
- long documents may feel heavy without summaries
- new users benefit from guided flows

No friction requires immediate fixes.

---

## 5. WHAT IS EXPLICITLY NOT NEEDED

Based on usage:
- no execution
- no state
- no memory
- no logging
- no analytics
- no configuration

The absence of features is a **positive signal**, not a gap.

---

## 6. SUCCESS CRITERIA — MET

Phase 80.2 is successful because:
- the CLI is actively used
- it answers real questions
- it reduces ambiguity
- it does not invite unsafe expectations

---

## 7. TRANSITION OPTIONS

After this phase, possible directions are:

- UX micro-refinements (optional)
- summary views (read-only)
- onboarding narratives
- or **no further changes at all**

No forward move is mandatory.

---

## 8. FINAL STATEMENT

Phase 80.2 confirms that the
Sapianta Chat CLI delivers **real value**
without expanding scope or authority.

The system is:
- usable
- trusted
- complete enough

PHASE 80.2 — REAL USAGE VALIDATED
