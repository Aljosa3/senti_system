Document: docs/FAZA_58_INTEGRITY_AUDIT_PRE_LOCK_VALIDATION_SPEC.md
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-12-15

Approval Statement:
The FAZA 58 specification is approved as the mandatory and final
technical-governance validation checkpoint prior to FAZA 59 and FAZA 60.

This approval confirms:
- FAZA 58 verifies system integrity without modifying system state
- Comprehensive audit of CORE components, Control Layer, governance artifacts, and audit logs is mandatory
- All validation checks are non-skippable and require completion before progression
- Binary readiness determination (READY / NOT READY) is authoritative technical assessment
- Validation failures block progression until explicit human resolution or risk acceptance
- FAZA 58 audit is unbypassable prerequisite for lock preparation
- FAZA 58 result does NOT execute CORE LOCK
- FAZA 58 output is exclusively for human lock decision in FAZA 59

Authorization Status:
- AUTHORIZED: Progression to FAZA 59 (Lock Preparation & Human Confirmation)
- NOT AUTHORIZED: CORE LOCK execution
- NOT AUTHORIZED: Implementation of any phase

Approved by:
System Architect & Custodian
