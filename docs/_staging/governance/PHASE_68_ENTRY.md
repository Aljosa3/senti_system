# PHASE 68 — ENTRY DEFINITION

Status: DRAFT
Preceding Phases:
- Phase 65 — Hard Core Lock (Immutable Core)
- Phase 66 — System Closure & Observability Definition (phase66-complete)
- Phase 67 — Post-Closure Design Space (Entry Phase)

Execution Authority: NONE
Implementation Allowed: NO (Entry only)
Agent Activity: FORBIDDEN
Scope: Design-to-Execution Boundary Definition

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Phase 68 defines the **formal boundary between design intent and execution capability**.

This phase does not enable execution.
It exists solely to **precisely define what execution would mean**, under which
conditions it could ever be allowed, and which constraints are absolute.

Phase 68 answers the question:

> “If execution ever occurs, under what exact governance structure would it be permitted?”

No execution follows from this phase.

---

## 2. SYSTEM STATE AT ENTRY

At entry into Phase 68, the following are invariant:

- Phase 65 Core Lock remains permanent
- Phase 66 closure remains intact
- Phase 67 introduced no operational change
- No execution pathways exist
- No agent autonomy exists
- All system behavior is non-executing and descriptive

Phase 68 must not alter the system state.

---

## 3. CORE PRINCIPLE — EXECUTION IS NOT A DEFAULT

Execution is **never implicit**.

In Senti/Sapianta:
- Design ≠ Capability
- Capability ≠ Permission
- Permission ≠ Activation

Phase 68 formalizes this separation.

Nothing designed in this phase is considered runnable, callable, or activatable.

---

## 4. SCOPE OF PHASE 68

### 4.1 PERMITTED ACTIVITIES

Allowed activities include:

- Defining execution classes (e.g. read-only, advisory, controlled, autonomous)
- Defining execution preconditions
- Defining execution authority models
- Defining consent and activation gates
- Defining audit and rollback requirements
- Defining what *cannot* ever be executed
- Drafting execution governance specifications (non-binding)

All definitions are **theoretical** and **non-operative**.

---

### 4.2 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

Explicitly forbidden in Phase 68:

- Implementing execution logic
- Creating execution hooks
- Simulating execution with effect
- Granting temporary or conditional execution
- Testing execution pathways
- Activating dormant modules or agents
- Reinterpreting Phase 65 constraints

Phase 68 cannot cause execution by design or accident.

---

## 5. EXECUTION CLASSES (DESCRIPTIVE ONLY)

This phase may define, but not implement, execution classes such as:

- Observational (read-only, no effect)
- Advisory (recommendation only)
- Assisted (human-mediated execution)
- Controlled (policy-bound execution)
- Autonomous (self-initiated execution)

Definition does not imply availability.

Each class must remain hypothetical in Phase 68.

---

## 6. ROLE OF CHAT AND INTERFACES

All chat interfaces:

- have zero execution authority
- may not escalate privileges
- may not simulate agent intent
- may not request activation

Chat may assist only with:
- explanation
- documentation
- governance clarification
- boundary enforcement

Chat is not an execution surface.

---

## 7. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES

Phase 68 guarantees:

- No execution without explicit later-phase activation
- No erosion of Core Lock
- No silent privilege escalation
- No ambiguity between “designed” and “enabled”
- Full traceability of any future execution decision

---

## 8. RELATION TO FUTURE PHASES

Phase 68 may prepare for:

- Phase 69 — Execution Preconditions Formalization
- Phase 70+ — Execution Authorization (if ever permitted)

Phase 68 itself authorizes nothing.

---

## 9. EXIT CONDITIONS

Phase 68 may be considered complete when:

- Execution concepts are fully defined
- Boundaries are unambiguous
- No implementation pressure exists
- Governance narrative remains stable
- All future execution remains explicitly gated

Completion of Phase 68 does not activate any execution phase.

---

## 10. SUMMARY

Phase 68 is the last phase where **execution is purely theoretical**.

It creates a hard semantic boundary:
Design can continue,
Execution remains locked behind explicit future consent.

Nothing crosses this boundary here.
