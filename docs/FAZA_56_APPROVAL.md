The FAZA 56 specification is approved as the authoritative architectural
definition for the Governance Guide and Role Delegation subsystem.

The approval confirms:
- Five-role governance model (System Architect & Custodian, Delegate, Co-Custodian, Auditor, Observer)
- Explicit, revocable, time-limited delegation principles
- Human-mediated operation with mandatory audit trail
- Non-transitive delegation (delegates cannot sub-delegate)
- Complete separation from execution and CORE access
- ADMIN MODE as governance context, not execution authority

This approval authorizes progression to FAZA 57 specification work.
No implementation is authorized by this approval.

System Architect & Custodian
