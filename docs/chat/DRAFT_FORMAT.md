# SAPIANTA CHAT — DRAFT OUTPUT FORMAT

Status: ACTIVE  
Applies To: Sapianta Chat  
Authority: ADVISORY ONLY  
Mutation: FORBIDDEN  
Execution: FORBIDDEN  

This document defines the **mandatory output structure**
for all drafts generated by Sapianta Chat.

All outputs MUST comply with this format.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

The Draft Output Format ensures that:

- all Chat outputs are predictable
- all drafts are human-readable
- all drafts are reusable by a Builder (if approved)
- no output is mistaken for execution or instruction

The draft is a **design artifact**, not an action.

---

## 2. DRAFT CLASSIFICATION

Every output MUST begin with one of the following headers:

- `# MODULE DRAFT (PREVIEW)`
- `# STRUCTURE PROPOSAL (PREVIEW)`
- `# DOCUMENTATION DRAFT (PREVIEW)`
- `# ANALYSIS DRAFT (PREVIEW)`

The word **PREVIEW** is mandatory.

---

## 3. MANDATORY DISCLAIMER BLOCK

Immediately after the header, the following disclaimer MUST appear:

This is a non-binding draft generated by Sapianta Chat.
No system changes have been made.
Human approval is required for any implementation.
