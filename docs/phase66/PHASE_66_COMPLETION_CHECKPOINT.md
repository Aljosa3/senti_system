# Phase 66 — Completion Checkpoint

Phase: 66  
Status: Completion Checkpoint (Normative, Phase-local)  
Date: 2025-12-22

---

## Purpose

This document formally declares Phase 66 complete.

It confirms that all intended Phase 66 components have been:
- defined,
- bounded,
- verified for compliance,
- closed against scope expansion.

Phase 66 introduces no authority, no execution capability,
and no autonomous decision-making.

---

## Phase 66 Objectives (Confirmed)

Phase 66 objectives were:

- establish safe, read-only observability,
- establish hypothetical, non-authoritative simulation,
- define a non-agentic interface (Sapianta Chat),
- enforce strict module dependency rules,
- preserve human decision sovereignty,
- prevent authority drift beyond Phase 65.

All objectives are fulfilled.

---

## Verified Artifacts

The following artifacts collectively define Phase 66:

### Governance & Safety
- `PHASE_66_GUARDRAILS.md`
- `MODULE_DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`
- `HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_WORKFLOW.md`

### Observability
- `observability/OBSERVABILITY_SCOPE.md`
- `observability/EVENT_SCHEMA.md`
- `observability/README.md`
- `observability/OBSERVABILITY_CHECKPOINT.md`

### Simulation
- `simulation/SIMULATION_SCOPE.md`
- `simulation/SCENARIO_TEMPLATE.md`
- `simulation/README.md`
- `simulation/SIMULATION_CHECKPOINT.md`

### Modules
- `MODULE_ENTRY_TEMPLATE.md`
- `modules/SAPIANTA_CHAT.md`
- `modules/SAPIANTA_CHAT_INTERACTION_MODES.md`

All artifacts are consistent with Phase 65 governance
and Phase 66 Guardrails.

---

## Compliance Confirmation

Phase 66 explicitly complies with:

- Phase 65 hard-lock and immutability,
- Chat ≠ Execution separation,
- Observability non-authoritative constraints,
- Simulation hypothetical-only constraints,
- Human-in-the-loop decision sovereignty.

No Phase 65 governance document was modified.

---

## Prohibited Post-Completion Changes

After this checkpoint:

Phase 66 MUST NOT:
- expand scope implicitly,
- introduce new authority,
- add execution paths,
- reinterpret Phase 65 rules,
- convert informational outputs into decisions.

Any such change requires an explicit Phase upgrade protocol.

---

## Transition Readiness

Phase 66 is now:

- structurally complete,
- architecturally stable,
- safe for downstream phase planning.

No further work is permitted in Phase 66
without explicit re-opening via governance protocol.

---

## Closure Statement

Phase 66 is formally complete.

It provides a safe, non-agentic foundation
for future phases while preserving full human control.

This checkpoint marks the official closure of Phase 66.
