# PHASE 66 — OBSERVABILITY CHECKPOINT

Status: CHECKPOINT (OPERATIVE)  
Phase: 66  
Scope: Observability  
Nature: Non-invasive, read-only, non-authoritative  

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS CHECKPOINT

This document formally closes the Phase 66 Observability definition work.

Its purpose is to:
- confirm what has been defined,
- explicitly state what is intentionally excluded,
- prevent scope creep or silent expansion.

This checkpoint introduces no new capabilities and modifies no governance.

---

## 2. WHAT EXISTS (CONFIRMED)

Phase 66 Observability consists of the following finalized artifacts:

- `OBSERVABILITY_SCOPE.md`  
  Defines the allowed and prohibited scope of observability.

- `EVENT_SCHEMA.md`  
  Defines the passive structure of observable events.

- `README.md`  
  Defines correct human usage and prevents misuse.

Together, these documents fully define Phase 66 Observability.

---

## 3. WHAT INTENTIONALLY DOES NOT EXIST

The following do NOT exist by design:

- no automation
- no alerts or notifications
- no decision logic
- no recommendations
- no scoring or optimization
- no aggregation or analytics
- no feedback loops
- no enforcement hooks

Absence of these elements is intentional and mandatory.

---

## 4. WHAT OBSERVABILITY WILL NEVER DO

Observability will never:

- influence decisions,
- suggest actions,
- optimize behavior,
- evaluate success or failure,
- rank outcomes,
- infer intent or quality,
- evolve into a control layer.

Any such evolution would violate Phase 66 constraints.

---

## 5. GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIP

Observability:

- references governance for traceability only,
- does not interpret governance,
- does not enforce governance,
- does not override governance.

All authority remains exactly where Phase 65 defines it.

---

## 6. COMPLETENESS STATEMENT

Phase 66 Observability is COMPLETE at the definition level.

No further observability features are required or permitted
unless explicitly defined as a new Phase 66 domain
and reviewed against Phase 65 constraints.

---

## 7. CLOSURE STATEMENT

This checkpoint closes Phase 66 Observability as a bounded,
passive, and non-authoritative subsystem.

Further Phase 66 work MUST treat Observability as read-only
unless a new, explicitly scoped initiative is opened.
