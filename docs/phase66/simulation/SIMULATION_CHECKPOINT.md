# Simulation Pipeline — Checkpoint

Phase: 66  
Status: Checkpoint (Non-Normative)  
Scope: Simulation domain closure

---

## Purpose

This document formally closes the Phase 66 simulation pipeline definition.

It confirms that simulation has been fully specified, bounded, and
explicitly limited to hypothetical, non-authoritative use.

This checkpoint prevents scope creep and unintended elevation of simulation
into decision-making or execution domains.

---

## Confirmed Scope

Simulation in Phase 66 is strictly limited to:

- hypothetical (*what-if*) scenario exploration,
- descriptive analysis of possible outcomes,
- explicit surfacing of assumptions and uncertainties,
- non-ranked, non-prescriptive result presentation.

Simulation does NOT possess and MUST NOT acquire:

- decision authority,
- recommendation authority,
- execution capability,
- optimization goals,
- autonomous behavior.

---

## Required Artifacts (Verified)

The following artifacts define the complete simulation domain:

- `SIMULATION_SCOPE.md`
- `SCENARIO_TEMPLATE.md`
- `README.md`
- `SIMULATION_CHECKPOINT.md` (this document)

Together, these documents fully specify simulation behavior and limits.

No additional documents are required for Phase 66 simulation completeness.

---

## Boundary Enforcement

Any attempt to:

- extend simulation into recommendation,
- convert simulation output into implicit decisions,
- integrate simulation with execution paths,
- centralize simulation results into an agent-like process,

constitutes a Phase 66 violation and MUST:

1. halt immediately,
2. explicitly identify the boundary breach,
3. escalate to governance authority.

No silent expansion or reinterpretation is permitted.

---

## Relationship to Other Domains

- Observability supplies factual signals.
- Simulation explores hypothetical interpretations.
- Authority and execution remain external.

Simulation MUST remain informational only.

---

## Closure Statement

The Phase 66 simulation pipeline is now:

- fully defined,
- intentionally constrained,
- governance-safe,
- closed to further expansion within Phase 66.

Any future modification or extension of simulation capabilities
requires an explicit Phase upgrade protocol.
