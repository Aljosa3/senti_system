# PHASE 66 — SIMULATION PIPELINE SCOPE DEFINITION

Status: DEFINITION (OPERATIVE)  
Phase: 66  
Nature: Hypothetical, non-invasive, non-authoritative  
Purpose: Explore consequences without action

---

## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines the scope of the Phase 66 Simulation Pipeline.

The Simulation Pipeline exists to evaluate hypothetical scenarios
("what-if") without triggering actions, decisions, or recommendations.

It introduces no automation and modifies no governance.

---

## 2. CORE PRINCIPLES

The Simulation Pipeline MUST be:

- hypothetical only (no real-world effects),
- read-only with respect to system state,
- non-authoritative (no decisions),
- non-prescriptive (no recommendations),
- non-optimizing (no best-path selection).

Simulation answers:
- *What could happen if X were true?*

Simulation does NOT answer:
- *What should be done?*

---

## 3. ALLOWED INPUTS

The Simulation Pipeline MAY accept:

- hypothetical scenario descriptions,
- assumed constraints and conditions,
- time horizons (explicit and bounded),
- references to existing governance or system components.

All inputs MUST be explicitly marked as hypothetical.

---

## 4. PROHIBITED INPUTS

The Simulation Pipeline MUST NOT accept:

- live execution commands,
- instructions to act,
- optimization objectives,
- decision criteria,
- authority transfer or delegation,
- implicit defaults that suggest preference.

If an input implies action, it is invalid.

---

## 5. ALLOWED OUTPUTS

The Simulation Pipeline MAY produce:

- descriptive outcome projections,
- enumerated possible states,
- dependency or interaction descriptions,
- uncertainty statements,
- references to relevant constraints or documents.

Outputs MUST be descriptive and plural where appropriate.

---

## 6. PROHIBITED OUTPUTS

The Simulation Pipeline MUST NOT produce:

- recommendations or advice,
- rankings or prioritization,
- single “best” outcomes,
- confidence scores tied to action,
- triggers or alerts,
- follow-up steps or next actions.

Rule:
If an output could be acted upon directly, it is forbidden.

---

## 7. RELATION TO OBSERVABILITY

Simulation MAY reference observability data for context only.

Simulation MUST NOT:
- aggregate observability into judgments,
- evaluate system performance,
- suggest governance changes.

Simulation and Observability are strictly informational.

---

## 8. AUTHORITY BOUNDARY

The Simulation Pipeline has ZERO authority.

It MUST NOT:
- influence decisions,
- initiate execution,
- escalate automatically,
- modify system state.

All authority remains exactly as defined in Phase 65.

---

## 9. COMPLETENESS STATEMENT

This document fully defines the scope of the Phase 66 Simulation Pipeline.

No simulation capability is permitted outside this scope
unless explicitly defined as a new Phase 66 initiative
and reviewed against Phase 65 constraints.
