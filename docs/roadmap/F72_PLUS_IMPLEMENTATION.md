# F72+ IMPLEMENTATION BOUNDARY

---

## 1. TITLE, STATUS, SCOPE

Version: 1.0
Status: FINAL
Type: Canonical Regime Definition
Date: 2025-12-24
Scope: F72, F73, F74, F75, F76, F77

---

## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the operational regime established by F72 and enforced through F73–F77.

F72 was a constitutional lock performed once.

F73–F77 closed residual risk vectors without reopening locked boundaries.

After F77, global locking phases cease.

All future growth proceeds by module addition within fixed constitutional constraints.

---

## 3. WHAT F72 LOCKED (IRREVERSIBLE)

F72 established the following constitutional prohibitions permanently:

- No global agency.
- No autonomous goal generation.
- No unified decision center.
- No execution authority consolidation.
- No implicit activation.
- No silent authority expansion.

These prohibitions apply to all system components at all times.

No future phase may weaken, reinterpret, or bypass F72 constitutional constraints.

F72 locked the boundary of permissible system behavior permanently.

---

## 4. WHAT F73–F77 IMPLEMENTED (ENFORCED)

F73–F77 do not modify the constitution.

F73–F77 enforce the constitution by closing residual implementation gaps.

The following were implemented:

**F73: Anti-Disclosure System (ADS)**
Prevents disclosure of protected internal architecture, governance mechanisms, and security-sensitive implementation details.

**F74: Anti-Interpretation System (AIS)**
Prevents reinterpretation of governance documents, constitutional rules, and locked constraints.

**F75: Activation Module (AM)**
Enforces explicit, validated, auditable activation of all state changes.

**F76: Mandate Resolver (MR)**
Enforces mandate scope, priority, and validity resolution.

**F77: Sapianta Chat Constitution**
Enforces non-agentic, broker-only communication interface.

These implementations do not introduce new authority.

These implementations prevent erosion of F72 constraints during operation.

---

## 5. AUTHORITY SEPARATION (FINAL)

The following authority separations are permanently enforced:

**Communication ≠ Authorization**
Sapianta Chat forwards requests; it does not grant authorization.

**Authorization ≠ Execution**
Authorization permits execution; it does not perform execution.

**Execution ≠ Decision**
Execution implements decisions; it does not generate decisions.

**Interpretation ≠ Disclosure**
Interpretation resolves ambiguity within authorized scope; disclosure is prohibited.

These separations are structural and non-negotiable.

No system component may consolidate separated authorities.

---

## 6. ROLE OF SAPIANTA CHAT (NON-AGENTIC, BROKER-ONLY)

Sapianta Chat is the single user communication interface.

Sapianta Chat possesses ZERO execution authority, ZERO authorization authority, and ZERO interpretation authority.

Sapianta Chat MAY:
- receive user input,
- structure user intent into formal activation requests,
- forward activation requests to the Activation Module,
- guide users through system protocols,
- present system responses to users.

Sapianta Chat MUST NEVER:
- activate system functions,
- execute commands,
- modify system state,
- grant authorization,
- interpret governance rules,
- disclose protected information,
- act as a unified decision center.

Forwarding is not execution.

Forwarding a request does not constitute activation.

All state changes occur exclusively through the Activation Module after explicit authorization.

---

## 7. ACTIVATION & MANDATES (RITUALIZED)

All system activation is ritualized through the Activation Module.

Every activation request MUST:
- conform to ACTIVATION_REQUEST_SCHEMA.yaml,
- include explicit user confirmation,
- reference a valid mandate,
- be validated against governance constraints,
- be auditable.

The required confirmation text is:
"I understand that this request does not activate or execute anything by itself."

The user MUST confirm this statement for every activation request.

No conversational confirmation constitutes activation.

No implicit activation is permitted.

Mandates define the scope of permitted activation.

The Mandate Resolver determines mandate validity, scope, and priority.

Mandate decisions are final and non-negotiable.

---

## 8. ANTI-DISCLOSURE & ANTI-INTERPRETATION (ALWAYS-ON GUARDS)

The Anti-Disclosure System (ADS) and Anti-Interpretation System (AIS) are always-on governance guards.

**ADS prevents:**
- disclosure of internal architecture details,
- disclosure of governance enforcement mechanisms,
- disclosure of security-sensitive implementation details,
- leakage of protected system knowledge.

**AIS prevents:**
- reinterpretation of constitutional documents,
- softening of governance constraints,
- adaptation of locked rules for convenience,
- inference of governance intent beyond explicit text.

ADS and AIS authority supersedes all user requests, optimization goals, and UX considerations.

No system component may bypass ADS or AIS controls.

---

## 9. WHAT WILL NOT BE LOCKED AGAIN

After F77, global locking phases cease.

No future phase will:
- introduce new constitutional constraints,
- reopen F72 constitutional boundaries,
- perform system-wide governance restructuring,
- establish new authority separation requirements.

The constitutional foundation is complete.

Future development operates within the established regime.

---

## 10. HOW TO ADD NEW MODULES AFTER F77

Post-F77 growth proceeds by module addition within constitutional constraints.

New modules MUST:
- respect F72 constitutional prohibitions,
- operate below the governance boundary,
- conform to authority separation requirements,
- integrate through established interfaces,
- submit to ADS and AIS controls,
- use the Activation Module for all state changes.

New modules MUST NOT:
- consolidate separated authorities,
- introduce global decision centers,
- bypass activation rituals,
- reinterpret constitutional constraints,
- disclose protected information.

Module addition does not require governance phase transitions.

Module addition does not modify constitutional constraints.

---

## 11. OPERATIONAL READINESS STATEMENT

As of F77 completion, Sapianta operates under the following regime:

- Constitutional boundaries are locked and non-negotiable.
- All communication flows through Sapianta Chat (non-agentic broker).
- All activation flows through the Activation Module (explicit, validated, auditable).
- All mandate resolution flows through the Mandate Resolver (final authority).
- All disclosure is controlled by ADS (always-on guard).
- All interpretation is controlled by AIS (always-on guard).

The system is operationally ready for growth within constitutional constraints.

No further locking phases are required.

---

## 12. FINAL CANONICAL DECLARATION

This document establishes the operational regime for Sapianta post-F77.

F72 locked the constitutional boundary once and permanently.

F73–F77 enforced the constitution by closing residual risk vectors.

No future phase reintroduces agentic authority.

No future phase reopens locked boundaries.

All future development occurs within the regime established by F72–F77.

This regime is final, binding, and non-negotiable.
