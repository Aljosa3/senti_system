# PHASE 67 — ENTRY DEFINITION

Status: Active (Entry Phase)
Preceding Phases:
- Phase 65 — Hard Core Lock (Immutable Core)
- Phase 66 — System Closure & Observability Definition (phase66-complete)

Execution Authority: NONE
Implementation Allowed: NO
Agent Activity: FORBIDDEN
Scope: Governance / Meta-Architecture / Phase Preparation

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Phase 67 formally opens a post-closure design space.

This phase exists to allow structured reasoning about future system evolution
WITHOUT enabling execution, modification, or activation of system capabilities.

Phase 67 is intentionally non-operational.

Its purpose is to:
- preserve the integrity of the locked Core
- prevent premature activation or drift
- enable disciplined preparation of future phases (68+)
- re-establish architectural clarity after closure

This phase is about **thinking, not acting**.

---

## 2. SYSTEM STATE AT ENTRY

Upon entry into Phase 67, the following conditions are immutable:

- Phase 65 Core Lock is permanent and irreversible
- Phase 66 is fully completed and closed (phase66-complete)
- No execution pathways exist
- No agent behavior is permitted
- No module has authority
- Observability is read-only
- Simulation, if referenced, is hypothetical only

No component of the system may reinterpret, weaken, or bypass these facts.

---

## 3. SCOPE OF PHASE 67

### 3.1 PERMITTED ACTIVITIES

The following are explicitly allowed in Phase 67:

- Definition of terminology and concepts
- Architectural reasoning and documentation
- Phase boundary clarification
- Meta-level governance descriptions
- Hypothetical future design discussion
- Preparation of future Phase Entry documents
- Structural analysis of prior phases (without reinterpretation)

All outputs must be descriptive, not prescriptive.

---

### 3.2 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

The following are strictly forbidden in Phase 67:

- Any form of implementation
- Code creation or modification
- Execution or test execution
- Agent instantiation or simulation with effect
- Activation of dormant modules
- Softening or redefining Core Lock constraints
- Implicit transition to later phases
- “Temporary” or “experimental” execution

Phase 67 cannot change the system state.

---

## 4. ROLE OF CHAT INTERFACES

All chat interfaces, including Sapianta Chat, operate under the following constraints:

- Chat has no authority
- Chat may not execute actions
- Chat may not propose implementation steps
- Chat may not simulate authority-bearing behavior

Chat may only:
- explain
- clarify
- document
- restate
- structure ideas

Chat is a non-authoritative interpretive surface only.

---

## 5. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES

Phase 67 guarantees the following invariants:

- Core Lock integrity is preserved
- No phase skipping is possible
- No hidden or implicit activation occurs
- No future capability is assumed as granted
- All evolution remains explicit and gated

Any future phase must be explicitly entered and documented.

---

## 6. RELATION TO FUTURE PHASES

Phase 67 does not:
- activate Phase 68
- imply execution readiness
- enable autonomy
- unlock agents

Phase 67 may:
- define potential future phase boundaries
- document possible evolution paths
- identify decision points requiring explicit consent
- prepare formal Entry Definitions for later phases

All such preparation is non-binding.

---

## 7. EXIT CONDITIONS

Phase 67 may be considered complete when:

- Future phases are conceptually mapped
- No pressure for execution exists
- Governance narrative is stable
- Phase 65 and 66 integrity is fully preserved

Completion of Phase 67 does not trigger any subsequent phase automatically.

---

## 8. SUMMARY

Phase 67 is a stabilization and reflection phase.

The system is closed, intact, and non-operational.
This phase exists to ensure that any future motion is deliberate,
explicit, and governed — or not taken at all.

No action originates here.
