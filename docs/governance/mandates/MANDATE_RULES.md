# Mandate Rules (Phase II.1)

## No Execution Rule
No mandate authorizes execution.

## No Escalation Rule
Mandates cannot escalate into actions.

## No Implicit Permission Rule
A mandate does not imply access, capability, or authority.

## Human Sovereignty
Only the human user can convert a mandate into an action,
and only in later phases.

## Phase Boundary
These rules apply to all phases ≥ II.1
unless explicitly overridden by a locked governance document.
