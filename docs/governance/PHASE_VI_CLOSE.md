# PHASE VI — EXECUTION FRAMEWORK (FORMAL CLOSE)

Status: CLOSED  
Phase: VI  
Scope: Execution architecture, contracts, escalation, capability taxonomy  
Authority: GOVERNANCE ONLY  
Execution: STILL DISABLED  

---

## Purpose

Phase VI defines the **entire execution framework** of the Sapianta system
without enabling execution.

Its purpose is to:
- establish immutable execution boundaries
- define legal and logical contracts for execution
- classify execution capabilities
- define escalation and approval paths
- ensure human sovereignty before any execution is possible

No execution is permitted in Phase VI.

### Architecture

### Governance
- `docs/governance/PHASE_VI1_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md`
- `docs/governance/EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/governance/PHASE_VI2_LOCK.md`
- `docs/governance/PHASE_VI1_LOCK.md`

### Capability & Escalation
- `docs/governance/PHASE_VI3_EXECUTION_CAPABILITY_TAXONOMY.md`
- `docs/governance/PHASE_VI4_EXECUTION_ESCALATION_PROTOCOL.md`

---

## Guarantees

Phase VI guarantees that:

- Execution logic exists **only as specification**
- No runtime path can execute actions
- All execution requires:
  - explicit user mandate
  - explicit contract acceptance
  - explicit escalation approval
- Governance remains superior to all runtime systems

---

## Non-Goals

Phase VI explicitly does NOT:

- enable execution
- implement execution engines
- allow automation
- permit self-activation
- bypass user authority

---

## Transition Rule

Only after Phase VI is closed may the system proceed to:

**Phase VII — Frontend & Interaction Layer**

Even in Phase VII:
- execution remains disabled
- UI is advisory or confirmational only

---

## Final Statement

Phase VI establishes the **execution constitution** of the system.

Execution exists as a concept — not as an action.

This phase is formally closed.
