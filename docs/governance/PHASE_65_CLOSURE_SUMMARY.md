📘 PHASE 65 — CLOSURE SUMMARY

Status: FINAL
Phase: 65
Lock State: HARD-LOCKED
Lock Tag: phase65-hard-lock
Date: 2025-12-22

1. PURPOSE

This document provides a concise, authoritative summary of Phase 65.

Its purpose is to:

record what was locked and why,

prevent accidental reopening or reinterpretation,

provide orientation for all future phases.

This document does not introduce new governance rules.
It summarizes already locked governance.

2. WHAT PHASE 65 ACHIEVED

Phase 65 established a stable, immutable governance core for Sapianta.

The following were permanently defined and locked:

2.1 Chat Core Nature

Chat Core is not an autonomous agent.

Chat Core does not define goals.

Chat Core does not make decisions.

Chat Core operates strictly under delegated authority.

2.2 Autonomy Boundary

Chat Core autonomy is explicitly bounded.

All boundary violations result in halt + escalation.

No implicit resolution or workaround is permitted.

2.3 Execution Separation

Chat Core has zero execution decision authority.

Chat Core mediates execution only after explicit authorization.

No autonomous execution loops are allowed.

2.4 Source of Truth

Phase 65 has a single authoritative document set.

A strict precedence order governs all interpretations.

Conversations, AI outputs, drafts, and implied intent have zero authority.

2.5 Transition Safety

Phase 65 governance is permanently read-only.

All future phases must operate above Phase 65.

Any Core modification requires an explicit Phase upgrade.

3. AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENT SET (LOCKED)

Phase 65 is defined exclusively by the following documents:

CORE_ANTI_ENTROPY_PRINCIPLE.md

PHASE_65_LOCK.md

F65_IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md

CHAT_CORE_ENFORCEMENT.md

F65_GOVERNANCE_CLARIFICATIONS.md

F65_AUTONOMY_BOUNDARY.md

F65_CHAT_EXEC_SEPARATION.md

F65_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md

PHASE_66_ENTRY.md

These documents are immutable under Phase 65.

4. WHAT PHASE 65 EXPLICITLY DOES NOT DO

Phase 65 does not:

introduce new functionality,

optimize performance or UX,

enable autonomous agents,

allow execution authority inside Chat Core,

permit retroactive reinterpretation.

Phase 65 is foundational, not developmental.

5. FINAL LOCK STATEMENT

Phase 65 governance is complete, immutable, and closed.

No part of Phase 65 may be:

weakened,

reinterpreted,

bypassed,

or reopened.

All future development proceeds on top of this lock, not through it.
