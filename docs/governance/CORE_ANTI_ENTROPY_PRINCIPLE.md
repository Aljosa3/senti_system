# SAPIANTA CORE — ANTI-ENTROPY PRINCIPLE

## Status
Foundational doctrine  
Applies to: Core, Chat Core, all modules, all future development

---

## 1. Core Responsibility

The primary responsibility of the Sapianta Core is not optimization,
performance, or output quality.

The primary responsibility of the Core is the **management of system entropy**.

---

## 2. Definition of Entropy in Sapianta

In the context of Sapianta, entropy is defined as:

- loss of semantic consistency,
- drift of rules over time,
- silent introduction of exceptions,
- local optimizations overriding global order,
- degradation of decision accountability,
- uncontrolled expansion of system behavior.

Entropy is a **natural property** of probabilistic and adaptive systems.
It cannot be eliminated, only regulated.

---

## 3. Core as an Anti-Entropy Regulator

The Core does not attempt to eliminate entropy by force.
Instead, it regulates entropy by:

- enforcing immutable boundaries,
- preserving clear hierarchies of authority,
- preventing silent rule changes,
- requiring explicit escalation for violations,
- isolating entropy to local, controlled domains.

The Core is therefore not an optimizer,
but a **stabilizer of meaning and structure**.

---

## 4. Hierarchical Containment of Entropy

Entropy is allowed to exist only in controlled layers:

- probabilistic reasoning,
- heuristic evaluation,
- learning processes,
- exploratory modules.

Entropy is **never allowed** to propagate upward into:
- Core laws,
- Chat Core governance,
- system-wide invariants.

---

## 5. Rule of Explicitness

Any change that affects:
- system behavior,
- decision authority,
- interpretation of rules,

must be explicit, traceable, and consciously accepted.

Silent adaptation is treated as entropy leakage
and is not permitted.

---

## 6. Development Implication

Every future module, feature, fix, or extension MUST answer:

1. Where does this introduce entropy?
2. How is that entropy bounded?
3. Who has authority to stop or override it?
4. What happens when it drifts?

If these questions cannot be answered,
the change is considered structurally unsafe.

---

## 7. Final Statement

Sapianta is not designed to prevent errors.

Sapianta is designed to **remain coherent over time**.

This principle is permanent and precedes all implementation decisions.
