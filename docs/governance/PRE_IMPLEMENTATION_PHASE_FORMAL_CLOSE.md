# PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PHASE — FORMAL CLOSE
## Constitutional Closure of FAZA VI–IX

**Status:** CLOSED  
**Scope:** Governance / Architecture  
**Execution:** PROHIBITED  
**Effective Date:** Upon commit  
**Reversible:** No (requires explicit new phase)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document formally closes the **Pre-Implementation Phase**, consisting of **FAZA VI through FAZA IX**.

Its purpose is to:
- confirm completion of all pre-implementation governance work,
- freeze the system state prior to any implementation,
- prevent implicit or accidental transition into execution,
- establish a clear handoff point for any future implementation phase.

---

## 2. Closed Phases

The following phases are hereby declared **complete and closed**:

- **FAZA VI** — Formal Lock Declaration  
- **FAZA VI.a** — Lock Verification Checklist  
- **FAZA VI.b** — Lock Enforcement Notes  
- **FAZA VII** — Execution Entry Conditions (DRAFT)  
- **FAZA VII.a** — Review & Hardening (DRAFT)  
- **FAZA VII.b** — Negative Scenarios & Abuse Cases (DRAFT)  
- **FAZA VIII** — Execution Layer Architecture (CONCEPT)  
- **FAZA VIII.a** — Boundary Stress Tests (CONCEPT)  
- **FAZA IX** — Chat ↔ Execution Protocol (CONCEPT)

All documents remain valid as references and constraints.

---

## 3. System State at Closure

At the moment of closure:

- Execution is **fully prohibited**
- Chat remains **non-executing**
- No runtime, API, or implementation exists
- All boundaries are:
  - defined,
  - stress-tested,
  - documented,
  - version-controlled

This state is intentional.

---

## 4. Freeze Declaration

No further changes may be made to:
- execution permissions,
- execution-related architecture,
- chat ↔ execution boundaries,

unless a **new, explicitly named phase** is opened with its own governance act.

Silence or inactivity does not constitute consent to proceed.

---

## 5. Implications for Future Work

Any future work must choose **one and only one** path:

1. **Open a new phase** (e.g. FAZA X — Implementation Readiness Gate)  
2. **Remain closed** with no execution or implementation activity  

There is no implicit continuation.

---

## 6. Authority and Accountability

This closure confirms that:

- responsibility for execution remains **external to the system**,
- no component has latent authority to act,
- governance documents override all informal assumptions.

---

## 7. Final Statement

The system is now in a **constitutionally stable, pre-implementation state**.

Nothing is missing.  
Nothing is pending.  
Nothing is allowed implicitly.

Implementation, if it ever occurs, will begin **after** this closure — not during it.
