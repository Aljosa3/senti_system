# FAZA VI — FORMAL LOCK DECLARATION
## Execution Lock & Boundary Act

**Status:** ACTIVE — LOCKED  
**Phase:** VI  
**Scope:** Entire System  
**Execution:** PROHIBITED  
**Overrides:** None  
**Effective Date:** Upon commit  
**Reversible:** No (requires new explicit phase)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document formally establishes **FAZA VI** as a **constitutional lock phase**.

Its purpose is to:
- explicitly prohibit execution within the Chat system,
- define a hard boundary between **understanding** and **acting**,
- prevent implicit or accidental transitions into execution,
- serve as a permanent reference point for all future phases.

FAZA VI does **not** add functionality.  
FAZA VI defines what is **not allowed** until a new phase is explicitly opened.

---

## 2. Definition of LOCK

**LOCK** means:

- No part of the system may:
  - execute actions,
  - trigger external processes,
  - perform side effects,
  - modify external or internal state beyond mandates.
- No execution logic may exist inside the Chat.
- No “test”, “dry-run”, or “temporary” execution is permitted.

LOCK is:
- global,
- absolute,
- independent of user intent,
- non-negotiable.

---

## 3. Scope of Lock

This lock applies to:

- the conversational interface (Chat),
- mandate creation and storage,
- inspect / read-only mechanisms,
- explanation, analysis, simulation, or clarification layers,
- any current or future modules unless explicitly exempted by a new phase.

The lock also applies to:
- hypothetical execution paths,
- “what-if” scenarios,
- execution described as a convenience or shortcut.

---

## 4. Prohibited Transitions

The following transitions are explicitly forbidden:

- understanding → execution  
- explanation → action  
- analysis → automation  
- mandate → execution  

Any such transition constitutes a **violation of system governance**.

---

## 5. PRE-EBM Confirmation

This declaration:

- fully preserves PRE-EBM as a superior safety mechanism,
- does not reinterpret or weaken PRE-EBM,
- introduces no exceptions or bypasses.

In case of conflict:
> **PRE-EBM always takes precedence.**

---

## 6. Rule of Doubt

If there is **any uncertainty** whether a behavior constitutes understanding or execution:

- it shall be classified as **execution**,
- and therefore **prohibited**.

No contextual, intentional, or subjective interpretation is allowed.

---

## 7. Responsibility

Under FAZA VI:

- the system:
  - assumes no responsibility for real-world actions (none are possible),
- the user:
  - retains full sovereignty over decisions,
  - must explicitly authorize any future phase that allows execution,
- the Chat:
  - may not request, suggest, or imply opening execution autonomously.

---

## 8. Conditions for Unlocking

Unlocking execution is **outside the scope** of FAZA VI.

Any change requires:
- a new explicitly named phase,
- a separate governance document,
- an explicit opt-in decision,
- clearly defined constraints and limits.

Until such a phase exists:
> **The LOCK remains in effect.**

---

## 9. Final Statement

By accepting FAZA VI:

- the system formally confirms that it **understands but does not act**,
- execution is acknowledged as real, powerful, and dangerous,
- no execution capability exists within the Chat.

FAZA VI represents a **constitutional boundary**, not a temporary restriction.
