# 🔒 PHASE 65 — CORE LOCK DECLARATION

Project: Sapianta / Senti System  
Phase: 65  
Status: **FORMALLY LOCKED**  
Date: 2025-12-20  

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document serves as the **formal, irreversible closure of Phase 65** in the Sapianta system build process.

From this point forward:
- the Core is considered **locked**
- governance rules are **final**
- no architectural reinterpretation is permitted

This document is a **system-level boundary marker**.

---

## 2. CORE LOCK STATEMENT

As of Phase 65 closure:

- The **Core governance layer is immutable**
- No AI system, agent, or human-assisted process may:
  - redefine Core rules
  - reinterpret governance constraints
  - introduce self-modifying Core logic
  - escalate execution privileges beyond defined gates

The Core may be **used**, but not **changed**.

---

## 3. EXECUTION CONSTRAINTS (CONFIRMED)

The following execution constraints are permanently enforced:

- Execution is **explicitly gated**
- Execution is **single-shot**
- No autonomous execution loops are allowed
- No recursive or self-triggering execution paths exist

Any execution capability outside these constraints is **invalid by definition**.

---

## 4. AI CAPABILITY BOUNDARY

This phase explicitly distinguishes:

- ❌ **No self-sovereign AI**
- ❌ **No autonomous goal generation**
- ❌ **No self-expanding authority**
- ✅ **Controlled adaptation within governed layers**
- ✅ **Learning permitted only in non-Core modules**

The system demonstrates **constraint awareness**, not consciousness.

---

## 5. GOVERNANCE FINALITY

All governance clarifications introduced during Phase 65 are final.

Specifically:
- Controlled layers may optimize internally
- System-wide rules may NOT be redefined
- Governance interpretation authority does NOT propagate

Any future change request affecting governance:
→ MUST be rejected  
→ MUST reference this document

---

## 6. FORBIDDEN FUTURE ACTIONS

The following actions are permanently forbidden:

- Reopening Phase 65
- Modifying Core assumptions retroactively
- Introducing “temporary exceptions”
- Bypassing governance via tooling or execution paths

Attempts to do so indicate **system violation**, not evolution.

---

## 7. TRANSITION STATEMENT

With this document in place:

- Phase 65 is **closed**
- Phase 66 may begin
- All future development MUST:
  - respect this lock
  - operate outside the Core
  - treat the Core as a fixed foundation

---

## 8. AUTHORITY

This document is authoritative by:
- architectural necessity
- governance continuity
- explicit system design intent

It supersedes all informal discussions regarding Core mutability.

---

**END OF PHASE 65**
