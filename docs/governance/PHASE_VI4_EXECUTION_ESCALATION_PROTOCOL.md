PHASE VI.4 — EXECUTION ESCALATION PROTOCOL

Status: LOCKED
Phase: VI.4
Authority: GOVERNANCE
Execution: DISABLED

Purpose

This document defines the mandatory escalation protocol
for any execution attempt above LEVEL 0.

Its purpose is to:

preserve human sovereignty

prevent silent execution

enforce layered approvals

create traceable accountability

Core Rule

No execution capability may be activated
without passing the escalation protocol.

Escalation is explicit, interruptible, and auditable.

Failure Handling

Execution is a process of consent, clarity, and control.

This protocol defines that process.
