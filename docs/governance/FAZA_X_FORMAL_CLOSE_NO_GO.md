# FAZA X — FORMAL CLOSE (NO-GO)
## Constitutional Closure After Formal NO-GO Decision

**Phase:** X  
**Status:** CLOSED (NO-GO)  
**Binding:** YES  
**Execution:** PROHIBITED  
**Effective Date:** Upon commit  
**Reversible:** Only via explicit new phase

---

## 1. Purpose

This document formally closes **FAZA X — Implementation Readiness Gate** following a recorded **NO-GO** decision in **FAZA X.c**.

Its purpose is to:
- seal the NO-GO outcome,
- prevent implicit or accidental transition to implementation,
- preserve governance integrity,
- establish a clear stop-state.

---

## 2. Decision Reference

The following decision has been recorded and is hereby enforced:

- **FAZA X.c — Formal GO / NO-GO Decision**
- **Outcome:** NO-GO

This outcome is binding.

---

## 3. Closure Scope

With this closure:

- FAZA X is concluded in its entirety.
- FAZA X.a and FAZA X.b remain valid as references.
- No implementation phase may be opened.
- Execution remains explicitly prohibited.

There is no partial reopening.

---

## 4. System State at Closure

At the moment of closure:

- Governance framework remains intact.
- No execution capability exists.
- No implementation work is authorized.
- All prior constraints remain fully enforced.

This state is intentional and stable.

---

## 5. Freeze Declaration

The following are frozen:

- implementation authorization,
- execution permissions,
- chat ↔ execution boundaries.

Any change requires a **new, explicitly named phase** with its own governance act.

Silence or inactivity does not alter this closure.

---

## 6. Implications for Future Work

Future work may:

1. Open a **new phase** with a distinct mandate, or  
2. Remain in the closed state indefinitely.

There is no implicit continuation from FAZA X.

---

## 7. Final Statement

FAZA X is closed by choice, not by failure.

NO-GO is a valid, deliberate outcome that protects the system from premature implementation.

Until a new phase explicitly states otherwise:
- implementation is forbidden,
- execution is prohibited,
- governance remains sealed.
