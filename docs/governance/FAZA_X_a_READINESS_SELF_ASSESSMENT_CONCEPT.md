# FAZA X.a — READINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT
## Concept Only — Internal Readiness Evaluation Before Any GO Decision

**Phase:** X.a  
**Status:** CONCEPT  
**Binding:** NO  
**Execution:** STILL PROHIBITED  
**Depends on:**  
- FAZA X — Implementation Readiness Gate (Concept)  
- PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PHASE — FORMAL CLOSE (FAZA VI–IX)

---

## 1. Purpose

FAZA X.a provides a **structured self-assessment** against the readiness criteria defined in FAZA X.

This phase:
- does NOT authorize implementation,
- does NOT record a GO / NO-GO decision,
- does NOT modify governance,
- exists solely to surface gaps, risks, and open questions.

---

## 2. Assessment Principles

- Honesty over optimism  
- Evidence over intention  
- Gaps are expected  
- “Unknown” is an acceptable answer  

Any unchecked item defaults to **NOT READY**.

## 3. Readiness Checklist

### 3.1 Governance Integrity

- ☐ FAZA VI lock is fully understood and accepted  
- ☐ No document contradicts FAZA VI  
- ☐ All execution-related work is explicitly blocked  
- ☐ Governance documents are treated as binding constraints  

**Notes:**

---

### 3.2 Conceptual Completeness

- ☐ Execution Layer role is clearly understood  
- ☐ Chat ↔ Execution separation is non-negotiable  
- ☐ Boundary stress tests reveal no unresolved breaches  
- ☐ Negative scenarios are accepted as real risks  

**Notes:**

---

### 3.3 Authority & Responsibility

- ☐ Implementation authorizer is identified  
- ☐ Responsibility bearer is identified  
- ☐ Stop / abort authority is defined  
- ☐ No shared or ambiguous authority remains  

**Notes:**

---

### 3.4 Scope Clarity

- ☐ Initial implementation scope is clearly defined  
- ☐ Explicit non-goals are written  
- ☐ Out-of-scope scenarios are acknowledged  
- ☐ No “implicit later additions” are assumed  

**Notes:**

---

### 3.5 Risk Awareness

- ☐ Known risks are documented  
- ☐ Worst-case scenarios are acknowledged  
- ☐ No risk is dismissed as “unlikely”  
- ☐ Risk acceptance (if any) is conscious  

**Notes:**

---

### 3.6 Operational Discipline

- ☐ No execution code exists  
- ☐ No feature flags hide execution paths  
- ☐ No test harness performs real actions  
- ☐ Rollback expectations are understood  

**Notes:**

---

### 3.7 Human Readiness

- ☐ Cognitive load is acceptable  
- ☐ Motivation is stable, not rushed  
- ☐ No external pressure is forcing GO  
- ☐ Willingness to say NO-GO exists  

**Notes:**

Based on the checklist above, the current perceived state is
