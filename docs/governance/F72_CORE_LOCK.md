It does not describe an event.
It defines a state.

## CORE DECLARATION

From the moment Phase 72 is executed, the governance core
is permanently locked.

This lock is absolute and irreversible.

No authority exists that may reopen, modify,
reinterpret, extend, or bypass this lock.

---

## SCOPE OF LOCK

The lock applies to all governance artifacts including,
but not limited to:

- phase definitions
- phase sequencing
- authority boundaries
- execution prohibitions
- intentional absences
- interpretation constraints
- governance meta-rules

All documents defining Phase 65 through Phase 71
are final and immutable.

## PROHIBITIONS

After the lock:

- No governance phase may be modified.
- No governance phase may be reinterpreted.
- No new governance phase may alter the core.
- No execution authority may emerge from governance layers.
- No implicit or explicit execution path may be introduced.
- No exception mechanism may be defined.
- No rollback mechanism may exist.

There are no emergency clauses.

## AUTHORITY STATEMENT

No human, system, process, or future phase
may claim authority over the locked governance core.

Authority is not transferable.
Authority is not inheritable.
Authority is not reconstructible.

## RELATION TO PHASE 72

This document defines the rules that apply
after that activation.

## FINALITY

This document is final.

Its existence is sufficient.
Its enforcement requires no mechanism.
Its validity does not depend on interpretation.

This lock stands indefinitely.
