# FAZA X.c — FORMAL GO / NO-GO DECISION
## Explicit Authorization Outcome for Implementation Readiness Gate

**Phase:** X.c  
**Status:** DECISION  
**Binding:** YES  
**Execution:** STILL PROHIBITED  
**Depends on:**  
- FAZA X — Implementation Readiness Gate (Concept)  
- FAZA X.a — Readiness Self-Assessment (Concept)  
- FAZA X.b — Authority & Responsibility Declaration (Concept)  
- PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PHASE — FORMAL CLOSE (FAZA VI–IX)

---

## 1. Purpose

FAZA X.c records the **explicit outcome** of the Implementation Readiness Gate.

This document:
- records a conscious decision,
- authorizes or forbids opening an implementation phase,
- does NOT itself start implementation,
- does NOT enable execution.

---

## 2. Decision Context

The following prerequisites have been established:

- Governance framework is complete (FAZA VI–IX)
- Readiness criteria are defined (FAZA X)
- Self-assessment has been recorded (FAZA X.a)
- Authority and responsibility are declared (FAZA X.b)

The system is therefore eligible for a **formal decision**.

---

## 3. Decision Options

Exactly **one** of the following options must be selected.

---

### ☐ OPTION A — GO

**Decision:** GO  
**Meaning:**  
Authorization is granted to open **FAZA XI — Implementation Phase**.

**Constraints:**
- FAZA VI remains fully enforced.
- Execution remains prohibited until explicitly enabled in a future phase.
- FAZA XI must:
  - have its own scope declaration,
  - respect all governance constraints,
  - include rollback and abort provisions.

**This option does NOT:**
- permit execution,
- permit partial implementation,
- bypass any prior document.

---

### ☐ OPTION B — NO-GO

**Decision:** NO-GO  
**Meaning:**  
Implementation is **not authorized**.

**Implications:**
- FAZA X remains active.
- Execution remains prohibited.
- No implementation phase may be opened.

This option is valid and final until explicitly revisited by a new phase.

---

## 4. Declaring Authority

The decision recorded here is made by:

- **Implementation Authorizer:** ______________________  
- **Responsibility Bearer:** _________________________  
- **Stop / Abort Authority:** _________________________  
- **Governance Custodian:** _________________________  

All roles must correspond to FAZA X.b declarations.

---

## 5. Rationale (Required)

Brief justification for the decision:

> __________________________________________________  
> __________________________________________________  
> __________________________________________________  

---

## 6. Effective Scope

This decision:
- applies only to **authorization status**,
- does not modify execution permissions,
- does not weaken governance documents,
- takes effect upon commit.

---

## 7. Irreversibility & Change Control

- A **GO** decision may only be reversed by a new explicit phase.
- A **NO-GO** decision remains in force until explicitly superseded.
- Silence does not alter this decision.

---

## 8. Final Statement

This document exists to ensure that **implementation begins only by choice, never by drift**.

There is no default outcome.  
There is no implied permission.  
There is only what is explicitly recorded here.
