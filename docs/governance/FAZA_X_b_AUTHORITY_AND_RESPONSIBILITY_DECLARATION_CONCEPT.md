# FAZA X.b — AUTHORITY & RESPONSIBILITY DECLARATION
## Concept Only — Explicit Authority Before Any GO Decision

**Phase:** X.b  
**Status:** CONCEPT  
**Binding:** NO  
**Execution:** STILL PROHIBITED  
**Depends on:**  
- FAZA X — Implementation Readiness Gate (Concept)  
- FAZA X.a — Readiness Self-Assessment (Concept)  
- PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PHASE — FORMAL CLOSE (FAZA VI–IX)

---

## 1. Purpose

FAZA X.b exists to **explicitly declare authority and responsibility** related to any potential implementation or execution.

This phase:
- does NOT authorize implementation,
- does NOT record a GO decision,
- does NOT enable execution,
- exists to remove ambiguity about *who decides* and *who bears consequences*.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **No authority declared = no implementation allowed.**

Undefined responsibility is treated as **explicit prohibition**.

---

## 3. Roles to Be Declared
