# FAZA X — IMPLEMENTATION READINESS GATE
## Concept Only — Go / No-Go Criteria Before Any Code Exists

**Phase:** X  
**Status:** CONCEPT  
**Binding:** NO  
**Execution:** STILL PROHIBITED  
**Depends on:**  
- PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PHASE — FORMAL CLOSE (FAZA VI–IX)  
- FAZA VI — Formal Lock Declaration  
- FAZA VII — Execution Entry Conditions (Draft)  
- FAZA VIII — Execution Layer Architecture (Concept)  
- FAZA IX — Chat ↔ Execution Protocol (Concept)

---

## 1. Purpose

FAZA X defines a **formal readiness gate** that must be passed *before* any implementation phase may be opened.

This phase:
- does NOT start implementation,
- does NOT authorize execution,
- does NOT allow partial coding,
- exists solely to answer one question:

> **“Are we allowed to even begin writing execution-related code?”**

---

## 2. Gate Philosophy

> **Readiness is a decision, not momentum.**

Implementation may begin **only if**:
- all conceptual work is complete,
- all risks are acknowledged,
- all responsibilities are assigned,
- all refusal paths are preserved.

Silence or enthusiasm does not equal readiness.

---

## 3. Mandatory Preconditions (All Required)

The readiness gate is considered **FAILED** unless **all** of the following are true:

1. FAZA VI remains fully intact and unmodified  
2. PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PHASE is formally closed  
3. FAZA VII conditions are reviewed and acknowledged  
4. FAZA VII.b negative scenarios are accepted as constraints  
5. FAZA VIII and VIII.a invariants are still valid  
6. FAZA IX protocol semantics are understood  
7. No execution code exists in the repository  

Failure of any item blocks implementation.

---

## 4. Human Authority Check

Before opening any implementation phase, the following must be explicitly answered:

- Who authorizes implementation?
- Who bears responsibility for execution outcomes?
- Who can halt implementation?
- Who can revoke execution capability?

Undefined authority = **NO-GO**.

---

## 5. Scope Declaration Requirement

Implementation readiness requires a written declaration of:

- what will be implemented,
- what will explicitly NOT be implemented,
- which scenarios remain out of scope,
- which risks are consciously accepted.

Absence of scope clarity blocks readiness.

---

## 6. Rollback & Abort Conditions

Before implementation begins, the system must define:

- how implementation can be stopped,
- how partially written execution code is handled,
- how accidental execution is prevented.

If rollback is undefined → **NO-GO**.

---

## 7. No-Shortcut Rule

FAZA X explicitly forbids:

- “just a prototype”
- “temporary execution”
- “hidden feature flags”
- “internal-only execution”
- “safe test execution”

Any shortcut invalidates the gate.

---

## 8. Decision Outcomes

FAZA X has only three possible outcomes:

1. **NO-GO** — Implementation is forbidden  
2. **GO (CONDITIONAL)** — New implementation phase may be opened with constraints  
3. **GO (EXPLICIT)** — Implementation phase formally authorized  

Until a GO decision is recorded in a new phase:
- execution remains prohibited,
- implementation must not begin.

---

## 9. Relationship to Future Phases

FAZA X does NOT:
- define implementation details,
- authorize execution behavior,
- replace governance documents.

It only determines whether **FAZA XI (Implementation Phase)** may exist.

---

## 10. Final Concept Statement

FAZA X exists to ensure that **implementation is a conscious act, not an accident**.

Code is powerful.  
Execution is dangerous.  
Readiness must be proven, not assumed.

Until FAZA X is explicitly passed:
- implementation is not allowed,
- execution is prohibited,
- governance remains sealed.
