# PHASE V — Chat to Advisory Pipeline (CLOSED)

Status: CLOSED  
Authority: NONE  
Execution: FORBIDDEN  

Phase V defines the complete non-executing advisory pipeline,
from raw chat input to human-facing output channels.

## Included Subphases

### V.1 — Chat → Mandate Bridge
- Chat input is interpreted
- Intent is detected
- Mandate is validated
- No execution possible

### V.2 — Advisory Output Renderer
- Advisory constraints are rendered
- Human-readable explanation is produced
- No instructions or actions allowed

### V.3 — Output Channel (CLI / API)
- Advisory output is delivered externally
- System boundary is enforced
- Execution remains blocked

## Guarantees

- No execution or side effects
- Full explainability
- Deterministic behavior
- Clear boundary between system logic and user interface

Phase V is complete and locked.
All execution-capable behavior must begin in Phase VI
under explicit governance.
