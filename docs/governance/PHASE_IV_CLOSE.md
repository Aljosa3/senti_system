# PHASE IV — CLOSED
Status: LOCKED
Scope: Architecture, Sovereignty, Trust
Execution: NONE

---

## Purpose

Phase IV defines and permanently locks the sovereignty boundaries
between:

- Server-side core
- Local user environment
- Privacy and trust guarantees

This phase is documentation-only.

No code, modules, or runtime components are introduced.

---

## Locked Documents

The following documents define non-negotiable boundaries:

- docs/architecture/CORE_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md
- docs/architecture/SERVER_SIDE_SAFETY.md
- docs/architecture/CORE_LOCAL_BOUNDARY.md
- docs/architecture/PRIVACY_BOUNDARY.md

---

## Guarantees

- The server core cannot access local user data
- Execution authority is never implicit
- User sovereignty is preserved by default
- Trust escalation requires explicit future phases

---

## Finality

Phase IV is CLOSED.

All subsequent phases MUST respect these boundaries.
No retroactive changes are permitted.
