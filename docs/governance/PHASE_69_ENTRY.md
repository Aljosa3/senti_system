# PHASE 69 — ENTRY DEFINITION

Status: DRAFT
Preceding Phases:
- Phase 65 — Hard Core Lock (Immutable Core)
- Phase 66 — System Closure & Observability Definition (phase66-complete)
- Phase 67 — Post-Closure Design Space
- Phase 68 — Design-to-Execution Boundary (DRAFT)

Execution Authority: NONE  
Implementation Allowed: NO  
Agent Activity: FORBIDDEN  
Scope: Execution Preconditions Formalization (Non-Operational)

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Phase 69 exists to formalize **preconditions for execution** without enabling,
authorizing, or implementing execution.

This phase does not define *how* execution works.  
It defines *what must be true before execution could ever be considered*.

Phase 69 answers the question:

> “What conditions must be satisfied before execution is even discussable?”

No execution is enabled by this phase.

---

## 2. SYSTEM STATE AT ENTRY

At entry into Phase 69, the system state is invariant:

- Core remains permanently locked (Phase 65)
- System closure remains intact (Phase 66)
- No operational change occurred in Phase 67
- Execution remains purely theoretical (Phase 68)
- No execution pathways exist
- No agent autonomy exists

Phase 69 must not alter this state.

---

## 3. PRINCIPLE — PRECONDITIONS ≠ PERMISSION

Satisfying preconditions does **not** imply permission.

In Senti / Sapianta:
- Preconditions describe readiness
- Permission requires explicit authorization
- Authorization requires explicit activation

Phase 69 defines readiness only.

---

## 4. SCOPE OF PHASE 69

### 4.1 PERMITTED ACTIVITIES

The following activities are allowed:

- Defining categories of execution preconditions
- Defining minimum governance requirements
- Defining human oversight expectations
- Defining audit, traceability, and reversibility requirements
- Defining explicit non-negotiable constraints
- Defining failure conditions that permanently block execution
- Preparing non-binding checklists for future phases

All outputs are descriptive and non-operational.

---

### 4.2 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

The following are strictly forbidden:

- Implementing execution logic
- Creating execution pathways
- Simulating execution with effect
- Granting conditional or provisional execution
- Introducing exceptions to Core Lock
- Redefining execution boundaries
- Collapsing preconditions into permissions

Phase 69 cannot authorize action.

---

## 5. CATEGORIES OF EXECUTION PRECONDITIONS (DESCRIPTIVE)

Phase 69 may define, without enabling, categories such as:

### 5.1 Governance Preconditions

- Explicit ownership and accountability
- Clear authorization hierarchy
- Immutable audit requirements
- Revocation and rollback capability

---

### 5.2 Human Oversight Preconditions

- Explicit human accountability and veto authority  
  *(not procedural or automatic approval mechanisms)*
- Clear escalation paths
- Non-delegable responsibility for outcomes

---

### 5.3 Technical Preconditions

- Deterministic or bounded behavior guarantees
- Strictly limited execution scope
- Fail-safe defaults
- Full observability prior to any execution consideration

---

### 5.4 Ethical and Safety Preconditions

- Explicit harm boundaries
- Defined unacceptable outcome classes
- Safety override requirements
- Irreversibility awareness

---

## 6. NON-IMPLICATION CLAUSE

The definition of preconditions within Phase 69:

- does not authorize execution,
- does not imply future activation,
- does not guarantee progression to any execution phase.

Phase 69 establishes constraints, not momentum.

---

## 7. SUMMARY

Phase 69 formalizes the **necessary conditions for considering execution**
while ensuring that:

- no execution is enabled,
- no authority is granted,
- no operational behavior is introduced.

Phase 69 exists to make execution difficult to justify,
not easy to enable.
