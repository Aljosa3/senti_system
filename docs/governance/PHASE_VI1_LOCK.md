# PHASE VI.1 LOCK — Execution Boundary & Design

Status: LOCKED
Phase: VI.1
Type: DOCUMENT-ONLY
Execution: FORBIDDEN

---

## Scope

Phase VI.1 defines the conceptual execution boundary and
the design constraints for any future execution capability.

No execution logic, simulation, API, or permission mechanism
exists in this phase.

---

## Locked Artifacts

The following documents are canonical and immutable:

- docs/architecture/EXECUTION_BOUNDARY.md
- docs/governance/PHASE_VI1_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md

---

## Guarantees

- No execution is possible
- No execution is simulated
- No execution interfaces exist
- No authority escalation is allowed

---

## Governance Rule

Any modification to execution behavior requires:
- a new phase
- explicit governance approval
- user-visible consent mechanisms

This phase is final and irreversible.
