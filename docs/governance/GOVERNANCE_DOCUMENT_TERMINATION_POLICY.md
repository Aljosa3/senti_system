# Governance Document Termination Policy

**Status:** Active  
**Applies from:** All phases  
**Scope:** Internal governance documentation  
**System:** Sapianta

---

## Purpose

This document defines the rule regarding the use of explicit termination statements (e.g. “End of document”, “Konec dokumenta”) in internal governance documents of the Sapianta system.

The purpose of this policy is to prevent misinterpretation of document completeness and to ensure consistent understanding of document finality within a systemically governed environment.

---

## Rule

> **Explicit termination statements are NOT mandatory for internal governance documents within the Sapianta system.**

The absence of a closing statement such as “End of document” does not affect the validity, completeness, or integrity of an internal governance document.

---

## Rationale

1. **Document finality in Sapianta is system-defined, not text-defined.**  
   A document’s state is determined by:
   - its location within the repository structure,
   - its phase context,
   - its status designation (e.g. draft, locked, entry, clarification),
   - and its version history.

2. **Structural and procedural governance supersedes textual markers.**  
   The system architecture provides stronger guarantees of integrity than a manual textual indicator.

3. **Termination statements provide no additional enforcement or protection** within an internal, version-controlled, and phase-governed environment.

---

## Permitted (Optional) Usage

- Termination statements **may be used optionally**:
  - for stylistic consistency,
  - for human readability,
  - or for documents intended to be exported or read outside the Sapianta system.

- Optional usage has **no effect on document status**.

---

## Explicit Clarifications

- The absence of a termination statement **does not imply** that a document is:
  - incomplete,
  - open-ended,
  - provisional,
  - or subject to implicit continuation.

- No document shall be retroactively modified solely to add a termination statement.

---

## Guiding Principle

> **In Sapianta, documents are finalized by system context, not by the last line of text.**

End of policy.
