# PHASE 71 — PRE-LOCK CONSISTENCY & READINESS VERDICT

Status: COMPLETED  
Type: Read-only / Archival  
Scope: Governance Integrity Review  
Precedes: F72 CORE LOCK  
Date: [insert date if desired]

---

## PURPOSE

Phase 71 exists solely to perform a strict, read-only consistency and readiness review
of the governance system prior to the irreversible F72 CORE LOCK.

This phase introduces:
- no implementation
- no interpretation
- no modification
- no extension
- no new mechanisms

Phase 71 is observational only.

---

## REVIEW SCOPE

The following phases were reviewed in full:

- Phase 65 — Hard Core Lock
- Phase 66 — System Closure & Observability
- Phase 67 — Post-Closure Design Space
- Phase 68 — Design-to-Execution Boundary (DRAFT, non-operational)
- Phase 69 — Execution Preconditions
- Phase 70 — Intentionally Absent

---

## CONSISTENCY CHECKS

### 1. Phase-to-Phase Consistency (65–70)

Result: PASS

All reviewed phases form a coherent, non-contradictory governance sequence.
No phase introduces reinterpretation or rollback of prior locks.

---

### 2. Implicit Execution Paths

Result: PASS

No explicit or implicit path to execution authority exists beyond Phase 65.
All post-lock phases remain non-operational by design.

---

### 3. Authority Containment

Result: PASS

Execution authority remains fully withheld.
No delegation, escalation, or indirect control mechanisms are present.

---

### 4. Phase 69 as Final Operational Filter

Result: PASS

Phase 69 defines execution preconditions without enabling execution.
No subsequent phase enables operational transition.

---

### 5. Phase 70 Absence Integrity

Result: PASS

Phase 70 is explicitly declared as intentionally absent.
Its absence introduces no semantic gaps, architectural ambiguity,
or implicit forward references.

---

## FINAL VERDICT

SAFE TO LOCK

The governance system is internally consistent, execution-safe,
and fully prepared for irreversible F72 CORE LOCK.

---

## NOTES

Phase 71 performs no action beyond verification.
It exists solely to formally justify the transition to Phase 72.

No further analysis is required.
