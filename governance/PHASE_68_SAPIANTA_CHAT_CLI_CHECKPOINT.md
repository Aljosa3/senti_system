Status: COMPLETED  
Phase: 68  
Date: 2025-12-XX  
Commit Reference: 5ed78e1

---

## Purpose

This checkpoint formally records the existence of a minimal Sapianta Chat CLI
as a controlled conversational interface.

This checkpoint does NOT introduce autonomy, execution, or intelligence.

---

## What Was Implemented

- A minimal command-line chat interface
- Deterministic input/output behavior
- Explicit capability registry with all capabilities disabled
- No execution layer
- No agent behavior
- No external access
- No system state modification

---

## Verified Properties

The Sapianta Chat CLI:

- Executes no actions
- Makes no decisions
- Calls no APIs
- Generates no data
- Modifies no system state
- Operates without autonomy
- Operates without agent behavior
- Operates without LLM intelligence

All capabilities are explicitly disabled.

---

## Governance Alignment

This implementation is compliant with:

- F65 Autonomy Boundary
- F65 Chat / Execution Separation
- F72 Core Lock constraints
- User decision sovereignty principles

This checkpoint introduces no violations or new authority.

---

## Outcome

The Sapianta Chat CLI is acknowledged as:

- A valid conversational shell
- A safe interaction surface
- A non-authoritative interface

This checkpoint authorizes further controlled extensions,
subject to explicit governance approval.

End of checkpoint.
