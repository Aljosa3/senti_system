# CORE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLE — PHASE 60

**Effective Date:** Phase 60 (CORE LOCK)
**Authority:** System Architecture
**Status:** Constitutional

---

## PURPOSE

This document establishes the governance principle for CORE management in Sapianta OS following Phase 60.

Core Lock at this phase is not a technical prohibition. It is a governance commitment to conscious, traceable, and confirmed intervention in the system's foundational layer.

All CORE modifications proceed through explicit decision, not implicit consequence.

---

## DEFINITION OF CORE

### What CORE Includes

CORE comprises the system's foundational layer:

- **Architectural principles** that define system structure
- **Identity rules** that establish what the system is
- **Semantic definitions** that determine system language
- **Governance mechanisms** that control system evolution
- **Long-term stable concepts** that persist across versions

### What CORE Excludes

CORE does not include:

- **Modules** — functional extensions that can evolve independently
- **Experiments** — exploratory implementations
- **Implementation details** — how principles are realized
- **Configuration** — system parameters and settings
- **Interfaces** — presentation and interaction layers

---

## PRINCIPLE OF CONSCIOUS CHANGE

Every intervention in CORE must satisfy three requirements:

### 1. Explicit Naming

The intervention must be explicitly identified as a CORE modification. No CORE change occurs as an unnamed side effect of other development.

### 2. Conscious Confirmation

The intervention must receive explicit human confirmation. The person authorizing the change must understand they are modifying CORE.

### 3. Recorded Decision

The intervention must be recorded in the governance audit trail. The decision, rationale, and authority must be permanently documented.

**Principle:** CORE does not change accidentally. CORE changes only when explicitly decided.

---

## ROLE OF AI AND CHAT LAYER

The system's AI components, chat interfaces, and development assistants operate under strict obligations regarding CORE:

### Detection Obligation

When processing a request that would modify CORE, the system must detect this fact before proceeding.

### Warning Obligation

Upon detecting potential CORE modification, the system must explicitly warn the user that the proposed action affects CORE.

### Confirmation Requirement

The system must not proceed with CORE modification without explicit user confirmation. Implicit consent is insufficient.

### Guidance Obligation

When refusing to proceed without confirmation, the system must explain what would be modified and what confirmation is required.

**Principle:** The system serves as guardian of CORE integrity, not as autonomous modifier of CORE.

---

## DEVELOPMENT AFTER PHASE 60

### Continued Evolution

Development continues normally after Phase 60. The system remains under active development.

### Default Development Mode

The default mode of development is **modular extension**. New capabilities are added as modules that operate above CORE.

### CORE as Stable Reference

CORE serves as the stable reference point that modules depend on. CORE provides the semantic foundation that modules build upon.

### Module Independence

Modules can be added, modified, or removed without CORE modification. Module evolution does not require CORE governance procedures.

### When CORE Modification Is Appropriate

CORE modification is appropriate when:
- Fundamental architectural principles require revision
- System identity must evolve
- Semantic definitions prove inadequate
- Governance mechanisms require strengthening
- Long-term stability demands foundational change

CORE modification is not appropriate for:
- Adding features
- Improving performance
- Fixing module bugs
- Adjusting configuration
- Enhancing interfaces

**Principle:** CORE changes when the foundation must change. Modules change when capabilities must change.

---

## PRINCIPLE OF MATURITY

### Sign of System Maturity

Core Lock at Phase 60 represents system maturity. The system has reached the point where its foundational layer is sufficiently well-defined to serve as stable reference.

### Condition for Long-Term Evolution

Stable CORE enables long-term evolution. Modules can evolve rapidly because they rest on stable foundation. Users can rely on semantic consistency. Developers can build without fear of foundational instability.

### Foundation for Future Phases

Phase 60 establishes the foundation for subsequent development phases. L3 and beyond depend on CORE stability. Advanced capabilities require stable semantic ground.

### Maturity Is Not Stagnation

Maturity means conscious change, not prevented change. Mature systems change deliberately. Immature systems change reactively.

**Principle:** CORE Lock is achievement of stability, not acceptance of limitation.

---

## GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY

### Human Authority Primacy

CORE governance authority rests with humans. AI systems advise, warn, and assist, but do not decide.

### System Architect Role

The System Architect holds primary authority for CORE modifications. This authority may be delegated but remains ultimately accountable.

### Audit Trail Requirement

All CORE governance decisions are recorded in permanent audit trail. Historical decisions remain accessible and explainable.

### Procedure Compliance

CORE modifications follow documented procedures. Procedures may evolve through governance process, but cannot be bypassed.

---

## INTERPRETATION

### Constitutional Status

This principle holds constitutional status. Other documents must comply with this principle. Conflicts are resolved in favor of this principle.

### Plain Language

When interpreting this principle, plain language meaning prevails. Technical interpretations do not override governance intent.

### Conservative Application

When uncertain whether something is CORE, treat it as CORE. False positives are acceptable. False negatives are not.

---

## CONCLUSION

CORE is not locked to prevent change.

CORE is locked to ensure change occurs only when necessary, only with awareness, and only through decision.

This is the difference between immature prevention and mature governance.

Phase 60 establishes that Sapianta OS has achieved the maturity to distinguish between its identity and its capabilities, between its foundation and its features, between its principles and its implementations.

CORE changes when CORE must change.

Everything else changes without CORE involvement.

This is the essence of sustainable long-term evolution.
