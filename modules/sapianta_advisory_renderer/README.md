Status: READ-ONLY  
Authority: NONE  
Execution: FORBIDDEN  

---

## Purpose

This module renders advisory output for human consumption.

It transforms internal, structured advisory data into a
clear and explainable response format.

---

## Guarantees

This module does NOT:
- Execute actions
- Provide instructions
- Offer recommendations
- Make decisions
- Modify system state

---

## Behavior

Input → Advisory Payload → Human-Readable Output

All rendering is deterministic and side-effect free.

---

## Example

Input:
- Advisory policy output from Phase V.1

Output:
- Structured explanation suitable for display
- Clear constraints on what is and is not allowed
- Explicit confirmation that execution is blocked

---

## Governance

This module is governed under Phase V.2.

Any change requires a new governance phase and lock.
